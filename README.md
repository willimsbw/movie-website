# Static Movie Webpage

entertainment_center.py generates a file called fresh_tomatoes.html, which
opens a static webpage displaying my favorite movies' poster art and name. When
a piece of poster art is clicked, it will play the movie's trailer.

## Getting Started

If you download all of files and run fresh_tomatoes.py, it will generate
fresh_tomatoes.html. Open that file to view the page, and that's it!

### Prerequisites

To run fresh_tomatoes.py, you'll need to install Python 3:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe

To view the fresh_tomatoes.html file generated when fresh_tomatoes.py is run,
you'll need a web browser installed.

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) - The web framework used
