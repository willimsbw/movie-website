# Static Movie Webpage

entertainment_center.py generates a file called fresh_tomatoes.html, which
opens a static webpage displaying my favorite movie's poster art and name. When
a piece of poster art is clicked, it will play the movie's trailer.

fresh_tomatoes.html. Open that file to view the page, and that's it!
